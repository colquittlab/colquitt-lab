Our lab encompasses approaches and ideas from systems neuroscience, developmental biology, evolution, and genomics, and' were excited to build a diverse and collaborative team of researchers. We're actively recruiting at several levels and look forward to welcoming new members. Please contact Brad at colquitt@ucsc.edu for more information.

We are located on the stunning UC Santa Cruz campus, embedded in a redwood forest on the northern end of the Monterey Bay, in the vibrant city of Santa Cruz.
