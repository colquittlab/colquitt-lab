#### To understand the development and evolution of behavioral complexity, we study the mechanisms that drive the diversification of neurons and neural circuits in birds.
{:.center}
#### We focus on the neural circuitry that is dedicated to the production and learning of birdsong, a complex sensorimotor behavior.

# Highlights

{% capture text %}
Our lab combines advanced molecular assays, imaging, and quantitative analysis of birdsong to understand:
- the gene regulatory networks that build birdsong neural circuitry during development
- how these networks intersect with experience during birdsong learning
- how modifications to these networks contributed to the evolution of birdsong and other complex learned behaviors.
