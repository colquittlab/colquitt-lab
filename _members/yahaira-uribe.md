Hello, my name is Yahaira Uribe, and I'm expecting to graduate in June of 2024 with a major in MCD biology and a minor in bioinformatics. Outside of academics, you'll likely find me out for a hike or stargazing while lying on the east field lawn. I've always been intrigued by how human behavior is controlled by different parts of the brain and the brain's plasticity and resilience to reconstruct/reform itself if need be. Although the Colquitt lab focuses on the development of finch brains rather than the human brain, it is fascinating to learn how finches exhibit similar learning patterns as humans. Through shadowing my mentors, I hope to continue learning.
